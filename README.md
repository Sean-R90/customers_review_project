# What is this project about?

This is my final project in order to finish my Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics.

The goal here is to practice the most used skill a data scientist should have, like:

- Data Cleanning- including:
  - Merging multiple datasets;
  - Feature selection;
  - Handling missing values and outliers.
 - Model selection for classification;
 - Hyperparameter tunning.
 
 I'll publish several documents connected to this areas here, including the use of different techniques, like Natural Languague Processing and how to handle with numerical and categorical data. 
 
 My intention is to use as much as possible the available data to learn the possibilities of the use of Machine Learning. 
 
 Please feel free to use and share the files, I just kindly request to refer to its source.
